        'content': 'I had fallen in love with my idea of God, but I am incapable of discerning whether or not my idea of God is aligned with the truth. In order to have a proper understanding of anything, especially God, one must understand themselves with exceptional clarity, but the more I learned about what type of beings we are, the more I realized that we are not built for discerning truth. We are blind sheep, who know not their right from their left.\n\n Falling in love with your idea of God is the most that anyone can ever do- perceiving past the ideal and into the real is impossible with human mental and sensory faculties. Real roundabout way of saying Kant was right I guess',

        'content': 'There are two types of negative events- mistakes and misfortunes. After any negative event, the primary objective is to keep a level head and plan your next steps. If the event is independent from future decisions (like losing a game of League), then the next step is to just keep a level head. Mistakes require the additional step of reflection- if the mistake is independent from future decisions, the reflection should come after planning, otherwise reflection and planning should occur simultaneously.',

        'title': 'Why grass is greener on the other side',
        'content': 'Grass is greener on the other side by virtue of being on the other side. The existence of the original metaphor is due to the limits of our perception. Taking the metaphor further, the grass on our side seems less green because we are able to identify the individual unhealthy strands of grass. When we look at the grass on another hill, our eyes reach their perceptual limits and can\'t see the unhealthy, only seeing a field of green from the healthy grass.\n\nThis principle doesn\'t only apply to the metaphor, but our objects of desire as well. You may see someone who makes a shitload of money and desire with all your heart to reach their side of the grass hill, but the closer you get to that side you realize that there is still so much dead grass- whether it\'s a difficult relationship you have to maintain, diminishing happiness from what previously brought you joy, the grass here is not nearly as pretty as you thought it was from the other side.\n\nNot saying that desires are bad, but no matter what side of the hill you\'re on you will have to learn to tend to your unhealthy grasses. Temper your expectations of desires and dreams and counterbalance them in consideration of your limited perception, and take care of the grass on your side while appreciating the healthy grass you have.',

        'content': 'Physically, it\'s true that you are what you eat, but psychologically you are what you love. Your identity is composed of values- relationships, people, status, wealth. When the things that you value are damaged, you hurt as much as a physical wound, if not more. When people that you value are hurt, you hurt with them to the degree that they are part of your identity.',

        'content': 'Selfishness is the love of the self, but if we redefine using the dynamic view of identity as defined in \'you are what you love\', then God\'s values include all of existence, and as such in that way he *is* all of existence. He is selfish because his \'psychological\' identity encapsulates everything that can be loved.',

        'content': 'In the same train of thought as the \'grass is greener\' post, but with a more somber undertone. I find it interesting how the word \'dream\' is used for two extremely different things, the phenomenon that occurs when humans sleep while being synonymous with an extravagant desire. The events experienced in the phenomenon may reflect the mental state of the human, but those dreams have no place in reality- maybe the same should be said for the other definition as well.',

        'content': 'A major aspect of the fear of death is fear of the unknown. We can be afraid of pain, but we learn to endure it and even dive into it because we know we will come out of the other end, but fear of death goes far beyond . What happens after death is unknown, but that\'s the beauty of it.\n\n If we set aside the fear of the unknown and take a look into the metaphysical event of death, I think it is quite exciting. **We transition into a completely foreign state of being/nonbeing**- from boring old human experience full of taxes and drama to something entirely different. It\'s most likely oblivion, a simulation could be pretty likely as well, but who knows?',
